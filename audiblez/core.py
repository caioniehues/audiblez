      - Uses the native 'aac' encoder (present in every ffmpeg build) instead of
        'libfdk_aac' (absent from standard apt/brew builds), which previously made
        m4b creation fail for typical users.
      - Encodes only once (the old code transcoded WAV->192k AAC->64k AAC).

      - Raises RuntimeError on ffmpeg failure so callers never report a false success
        over a missing/corrupt output file.
      - Cleans up temp files via try/finally even when ffmpeg fails.
